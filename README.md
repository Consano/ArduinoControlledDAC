# ArduinoControlledDAC
This is a personal project to create an Arduino based DAC for use in Oscilloscope visualizations like the following

The eventual goal is to have a small package that can be plugged into a 2 channel oscilloscope in XY mode and draw any given input function to a reasonable accuracy and with enough speed that it can be used as a functional DAC in addition to visualizations.

With this project I hope to either learn or reinforce the following skills:
- C++ (and the Arduino Library)
- KiCAD
- Etching based PCB prototyping
- Soldering
- Device Design (for 3D printed Casings and the like)
- Custom PCBs from a manufacturer
- Github version control and documentation

While this may not result in a finished product I hope to at least get a functional prototype that I can then springboard into my senior project either in totality or through the experience gained here.
